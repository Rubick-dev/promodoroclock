### Introduction  
This website counts down a user set timer and allocates a break which also is set by the user. Both default to 25 and 5 minutes respectively.

### Instructions
There are 3 groups each comprising 2 buttons for a total of 6 buttons the user can click, however 7 buttons after the start toggles into pause once clicked:  
1. Break time setting buttons - Allocate the length of time for the user to break when the active timer reaches zero.  
2. Active timer setting buttons - identical to the break buttons with these setting the active timer length.  
3. Start / Pause / Reset buttons -   
  a. Start(green) - starts the clock, diables the break and active timer buttons and toggles into the pause button.  
  b. Pause(yellow) - pauses the count down timer and toggles the button into the start button.  
  c. Reset(red) - Resets the page back to original form and enables all buttons again.   
 
### The Code / Tools used:    
1. HTML5 & CSS3 / Bootstrap.
2. JavaScript ES5 / ES6 used ternary operators fairly heavily for the first time.
